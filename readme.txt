V2 of the RAVEn script, now moved to perl

If all you want is to have status info of power consumption over the past few minutes and/or over the past
month, then you may be better off just using the V1 script.

The below assumes that you have done the other required steps such as:
* Purchased a RAVEn USB device (http://rainforestautomation.com/raven). Note that it is quite likely that the
same script will work with an EMU or EMU-2 device (http://rainforestautomation.com/emu-2) but this has not been
tested.
* Linked it to your smart meter (eg via the UE portal - https://energyeasy.ue.com.au/)
